**Project description:** 

The input is pair of the images of the person and the cloth. The output is the fitted image of the cloth on the person. 


### 1. Theory

The theory used in this project is based upon a popular concept in Theory of Computation which is Finite State Machines. The process has been divided into three states
<ul>
<li> Open Eyes</li>
<li> Closed Eyes </li>
<li> Drowsiness </li>
</ul>

The current state is derived from the position of the face landmarks. Based on those landmarkds, the state is changed. As the state of the eye is chnaged, the counter increases and the blinks are calculated.
