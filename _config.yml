  I am currently with UnrealAI where I apply deep learning to solve real-world problems 
  in computer vision and bring some of the solutions to edge devices. I am also responsible 
  for providing research support by analysing reseach papers and theory validation.

  Apart from deep learning, I am well aquainted with services like Google Cloud Platform,
  Amazon Web services, Flask, Kubernates and Continous Deployment.
